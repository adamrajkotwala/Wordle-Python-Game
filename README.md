## About this project

We will be implementing Wordle using python. The project will be able to run on a browser and users will be able to guess words. They are limited to five tries to get the daily word correct. Our team will also try to put a few twists into the project with more on that later to come.

## Platform

We will be using VScode and implement our project.

## Frameworks/Tools

The tools that we are using to code would be python. Our end goal is getting a working version to run in the crhome browser
and we will be using a phython shell extension to do so. 

## How to build/compile

We will be building the project pip for python. This project does not require a specific operating system to run.
